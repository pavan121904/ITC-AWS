25.How can you pass command-line arguments to a Bash script?
You pass arguments to a script like passing notes. They are available inside the script as $1, $2, and so on, where $1 is the first argument, $2 is the second, and so forth.
26.Describe the purpose of the case statement in Bash.
A case statement is like a menu with options. It helps your script choose what to do based on the value of a variable or expression. It's great for handling multiple conditions.
27.What is the role of functions in Bash scripts, and how are they defined?
Functions are like reusable recipes in your script. You define them with function_name() { ... }, and you can call them to perform specific tasks. They help keep your script organized.
28.How can you handle errors and exceptions in Bash scripts?
Error handling is like having a backup plan. You can use if statements to check for errors and exit the script with an error code (exit 1) if something goes wrong.
29.Explain the concept of environment variables in Bash.
Environment variables are like global settings for your system. They store information that various programs and scripts can access, like your username ($USER) or system settings.
30.What is process substitution in Bash, and when is it useful?
Process substitution is like connecting two processes with a pipe. It lets you use the output of a command as input for another, as if they were files. It's handy for complex command sequences.

51.Explain the differences between hard links and symbolic links in Linux.
Hard Links: Hard links are like mirrors of a file. They share the same data blocks on disk and have the same inode number. Changes to one hard link affect all others. They only work within the same filesystem.
Symbolic Links (Symlinks): Symlinks are like shortcuts. They point to the target file by its path and filename. Changes to the target file don't affect symlinks, and they can span filesystems.
52.How do you create a Bash script that runs as a daemon (background process)?
You can make a Bash script run as a daemon by using tools like nohup and & to detach it from the terminal. Additionally, you might need to manage its lifecycle with PID files.
53.Describe the purpose of process groups and sessions in Linux.
Process groups and sessions are like team management tools for processes. They allow you to control and organize sets of related processes, enabling features like job control and terminal control.
54.What is the purpose of the nohup command in Linux, and how does it work?
nohup is like a protector for your processes. It lets them continue running even if you log out or close the terminal. It works by redirecting standard input and output to files.
55.How can you monitor system performance and resource utilization using Linux command-line tools?
You can use tools like top, htop, free, vmstat, and iostat to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real-time. These tools provide insights into system performance.
56.What is the role of chroot in Linux, and how can it be used for security?
chroot is like a virtual jail for processes. It restricts them to a specific directory, preventing access to the rest of the system. It's used for security and isolation, especially in services like web servers.
57.Explain the concept of Linux containers and containerization technologies like Docker.
Linux containers are like portable boxes for applications. They package an app and its dependencies together, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Docker is a popular tool for creating, deploying, and managing containers.
58.How can you automate backups of critical data in a Linux environment using Bash scripts?
You can create Bash scripts that use tools like rsync or tar to back up files to remote locations or external storage devices. You can schedule these scripts using cron jobs for automation.
59.Describe the use of the rsync command for efficient file synchronization in Linux.
rsync is like a smart file copier. It syncs files and directories efficiently by only transferring differences between the source and destination. It's great for backups and keeping data in sync.
60.How do you use regular expressions (regex) in Bash scripts for text pattern matching?
